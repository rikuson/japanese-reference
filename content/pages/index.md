Hi there. Here is a good sample for you if you are starting with Phenomic and
React. It provides a simple but powerful codebase that you will be able to
adjust as you wish pretty easily. Be sure to check out the
[source code of this theme](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/tree/master/examples/react-app-blog).

Before asking any question about Phenomic, be sure to read the documentation :

- [Getting Started with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/en/tutorials/)
- [Documentation](https://phenomic.io/en/packages/core/docs/)

Also take a look at
[existing websites that use Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/en/showcase/), some
projects share their source code!

You may want to take a look at the [404.html](/404.html) and tweak the render.
